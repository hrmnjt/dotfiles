# Dotfiles

Welcome to the dotfiles repository. This is evolving everyday with me and is not even close to good at this moment. Please use your discretion while using this. I would be improving this for generic use at a later point of time. Please [mail](mailto:hrmnjt@hrmn.in) me or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/hrmnjts) for any constructive criticism or feedback.


Setting up (for now, hardcoded):

```bash
